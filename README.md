```
./daily_maintenance.sh
```

To perform a thorough system cleanup:
```
./mac_cleanup.sh
```

For Homebrew maintenance:
```
./homebrew_maintenance.sh
```

To perform a quick Homebrew update (skipping cleanup):
```
./homebrew_maintenance.sh --quick
```

### Development Setup

```

## Requirements

- macOS Sonoma 14.0 or higher
- Administrator privileges
- Internet connection (for scripts that require downloads)
- Homebrew (for scripts that manage packages)
- Full Disk Access permission for Terminal (for some security scripts)

## Compatibility

These scripts are primarily tested on macOS Sonoma 14.0+, but most should work on recent macOS versions with minimal modifications.

## Security Considerations

Many of these scripts modify system settings and require administrator privileges. Review each script before running to ensure you understand the changes that will be made to your system.

Scripts that modify security settings will create backups of original configurations where possible.
